I'm tired. 


I was born into a family that barely survives with their income. 

I did not have a good childhood. 

I didn't have happy moments in my life that often. 
when I did, I would remember them because life was always shitty to me. 


I don't even have a proper room, not to mention it's tiny as well.


"be grateful, atleast you live under a roof" they said. 

I've seen people happier even when they're homeless. 

I try to be grateful. 

life is already bad. 

but still, I've been saying this phrase for months now: "new problems everyday"

my country is such a piece of shit, I don't know why I was born here, I don't how I got this unlucky, I hated this place, it always had issues, it was so dirty as well, it's disgusting, I fucking hate it here. 

I can't seem to get it a break, problems after problems. 

why? 


why me? 


what did I do?


my life is already bad, why are you making it even worse? 

I asked these questions everyday. 

I didn't realize one thing. 

I was the problem. 

my mother struggles financially because of me,i was apparently unwanted, a forced marriage she was in, she had me, somehow loved me and took me in even though she was already struggling, I was such a problem for her, I could see it, I was a problem for you as well Lynn.

but.

rhwres a solution. 

I could just kill myself. 

ive been thinking about it for awhile
life is already bad so may as well end it right? I'm sorry, this must be annoying Lynn, you think I'm guilt tripping you into coming back, that's understandable, but no, it's not like that, I want to die because I'm tired, there's always problems everyday, I can't seem to catch a break, I'm slowly going insane, I forgot, you were such a great distraction from my irl problems, I guess being Inlove does have it benefits lol. 



I just don't want to deal with this, you know? I mean it's unfair, Im starting to slowly lose my mind, I can't really endure this much, ever since I was born, I always hated people, I don't like them, they're weird and always so self centered, when I was younger my mindset was much more.. "Free" or embraceful. 


the internet was having issues again and it turns out to be the country having issues for no fucking reason, they always somehow find reasons to be a sad piece of shit lol.
but that's not why I'm upset, I'm upset because it reminded me of the time my wifi went out for a week, and then it reminded me, "wow, I forgot I lived in such a shitty country" I absolutely forgot how unlucky I was, or maybe I forgot intentionally.

im alone, I don't anyone to talk to this about besides myself, but then again I should just leave you alone, you need to move on, all I'm doing is just bothering you and making you feel guilty, I just don't know what to do, I want what we had back, but I'm so afraid, we broke up so many times, we would just break up again if we got back together, if only I could've been better, being alone has taken a toll on me, without you Lynn, im back to reality, I have to take in this shitty environment I live in, i guess when you were here, I didn't gave anything to worry about Lmao. 

but now I do, I really hate being alive. 

there's alot you need to know


I've been checking on you so much it almost feels like I'm stalking, I shouldn't be here, I need to leave, to move on, but I can't, but If I don't it'll be a loop all over again, I'm still so worried about you. 


I plan to get a firearm when I'm older, I'll use it on myself when life goes bad. 

I don't have a reason to live, I don't want a stupid fucking job, or study and become smart, none of it matters anymore, I don't know who I am or where I am anymore, I'm so lost. 


I'm so miserable, I bet my younger versions of me would absolutely despise me. 


I'm fighting between decisions, I want it back, but I don't. 
I want to talk to you, but I don't. 
I want to feel happy again, but I don't. 

"I miss her" "your the reason shes gone" 
"I'm sorry" "are you?" 
"I regret doing this" "here we go again" 

I'm always fighting with myself 

why did I have to do this, I just look pathetic now, I just look like Im using guilt trips now. 


I guess when your not around to distract me, I lose my mind, I lost touch of reality, I'm going insane, and I deserve it. 

I miss you, I really do, a hug from you would've fixed all of my problems, I was so strong at first, making you go away, because I knew I'd do this sort of stuff eventually, im not strong, I'm weak, God help me, I just wish I'd die in my sleep.
